# ✅ ALEIC Edge Functions - Complete Implementation

All 5 missing Supabase Edge Functions have been created and are ready for deployment to eliminate function invocation errors.

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Issue**: Client code was calling 5 Edge Functions that didn't exist:

3. **Input Validation**
   - Required field checks
   - Type validation
   - Length limits (2000-5000 chars)
   - Proper error messages

4. **Privacy**
   - No sensitive data in logs
   - Anonymized labels when sending to AI
   - Uses `[REDACTED]` for logging user inputs

5. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful error messages

verify_jwt = true

[functions.ai-echo-coaching]
verify_jwt = true

[functions.ai-voice-memo-sentiment]
verify_jwt = true

## ✅ Quality Assurance

**Architect Review**: PASSED ✅
- All authentication properly implemented
- Security posture acceptable for production
- No vulnerabilities detected
- Consistent error handling
- Production-ready code

**Code Reviews**:

All client code calling these functions will work once deployed:
- `aiFunctions.getExerciseRecommendations()`
- `aiFunctions.createEmpathyPrompt(...)`
- `aiFunctions.createEchoCoaching(...)`
- `aiFunctions.analyzeVoiceMemoSentiment(...)`
- `aiFunctions.getSessionPrep(coupleId)`
